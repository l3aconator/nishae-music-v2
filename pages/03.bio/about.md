Nishae is a singer-songwriter residing in Portland, Oregon. Her musical style is most closely identified as singer-songwriter blended with hints of R&B. When she started this project it was all about sounds and creating a ‘feel’ of emotive arrangements. She chooses emotionally charged piano that is soft but also has a rich resonant sound often intertwining her vocals with airy reverb and strong harmonies. She combines a cinematic feel, R&B vocal harmonies, and emotionally driven piano segments. Nishae has been writing and recording her own music since high school as a hobby. She recorded her first project as an independent artist in her home studio in Portland, OR.  While creating this project she collaborated with her close friend, mentor and pianist, Leos Cernousek.

She wanted this album to be from her soul, creating something that came from herself with her truest of emotions. “I wanted to create a project that was based purely on what I am passionate about. I didn’t want to think about genre, or impressing people. I wanted to create something that came from my heart.”

Her project developed a bigger purpose when her brother was diagnosed with lupus in 2014. Her goal is to encourage others to live their dreams. By fulfilling her Meraki mission she hopes to encourage others to live their dreams, if only partially. She is calling this the Meraki mission. The purpose is to encourage others by sharing stories of people pursuing their own dreams. You can find more information about the Meraki mission [here](/blog).

>I wanted to create a project that was based purely on what I am passionate about. I didn’t want to think about genre, or impressing people. I wanted to create something that came from my heart. Once I realized how short life really is, I didn’t want to let fear or judgments made by others stop me from making music, and pursuing my passion.
