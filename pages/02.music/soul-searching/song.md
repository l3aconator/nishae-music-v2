**Verse one:**
<br />
After all the yelling is done,
And there’s nothing left to say, silence, it starts to scream,
When I try to stop myself from crying, close my eyes and let the smoke clear,
and let the smoke clear,
I know I can do better, but I stay, What’s my worth of letting you treat me this way,
<br />

**Chorus:**
<br />
You really got me soul searchin
You really got me soul searchin
You really got me soul searchin
You really got me soul searchin
<br />

**Verse two:**
<br />
Tip toe around shattered glass,
I replay the scene in my head, it gets worse each time
When I try to stop myself from trusting I can’t let go, were in too deep, I’m in too deep
And I know I deserve better but I stay, what’s my worth of leaving you this way
<br />

**Chorus:**
<br />
You really got me soul searchin
You really got me soul searchin
You really got me soul searchin
You really got me soul searchin
