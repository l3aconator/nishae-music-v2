**Verse one:**
<br />
I like the way you hold at me night,
I like the way it feels so right.
If you're looking for someone to talk to, if you're looking for someone to care, if you want I could hold you now.
<br />

**Chorus:**
<br />
Come Way with me, come away with me, leave as if nothings behind you,
Come away with me, come away with me, leave as if nothings behind you.
Come away with me, come away with me, Leave
<br />

**Verse two:**
<br />
I dream of us in a distant place,
where I can put sweet kisses on your face,
If you're looking for someone to talk to, if you're looking for someone to cares, if you want I could hold you now
<br />

**Chorus:**
<br />
Come Way with me, come away with me, leave as if nothings behind you,
Come away with me, come away with me, leave as if nothings behind you.
Come away with me, come away with me, leave as if nothings behind you.
Come away with me, come away with me, leave as if nothings behind you.
Come away with me, come away with me, ooooooooo, (backround vocal; come away)
<br />

Come away with me, come away with me, Leave
