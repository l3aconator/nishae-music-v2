The purpose is to motivate others. Let’s share our struggles, our downfalls, our low-points. Lets share what we are passionate about and how these passions can make life better for ourselves and the people around us. Lets share that through struggle comes growth and healing. When faced with hardship I don’t want people to give up. I want to highlight passionate individuals who fight for a life they love and enjoy. Individuals that have taken the worst parts of their life and turned it into their own healing. This is what I am calling the Meraki movement.

So, this is about you. This is about building a community, and finding other individuals who turned the worst times of their lives into motivation to create. Creating art, creating their own healing, creating their own happiness.

I want you to live your dreams. ‘Fricken go for it! We get one chance. I understand not everyone can quit their job and leave their responsibilities behind. But, if living even part of your dream creates happiness that’s what I want to motivate others to do. I want to share stories of people who have given their whole heart to their work. Music is one expression, but there are many others such as, humanitarian work, cooking, drawing, painting, dancing, or any form of expression that comes from the soul. Lets give some visibility to the struggle and the power that passion has to spark happiness.

 If you or someone you know would like to share their story and their artwork/healing. I'll interview you and let's spread some light. Please email me here.
