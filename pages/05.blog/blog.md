# Meraki
*Meraki is a word that modern Greeks often use to describe doing something with soul, creativity, or love&mdash;when you put “something of yourself” into what you’re doing, whatever it may be.* This blog is for you. This is about building a community, and finding other individuals who turned the worst times of their lives into motivation to create.
