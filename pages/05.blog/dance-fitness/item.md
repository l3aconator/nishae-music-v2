Dance has been a part of my life since I was child. Before this project was even a thought,  I felt the correlation between dance and healing.  I have decided I would add this into my meraki mission. I have met some of my closest friends through dance. We have used dance to escape bad times. Dance helped me get through college. Maybe it was luck, or part of my path, I got the chance to nanny for a family while I was in college, and the mother is the most fabulous Dance fitness instructor (Shoutout to Gina Wonder). Through her passion, my own passion for dance grew. By the way, If you are in the Portland area she teaches a class called Hip Hop Turn-up. IF you would like more info on that leave a question in the comments below.

I have worked at a gym in some capacity for the past seven years teaching zumba and Ujam. I discovered that dance has just as much expression as singing and writing music. I have seen the changes in confidence and happiness it has brought to my life and to others. Dance has brought me some of the closest friends. I would like to share some videos of the positive energy that takes place in class. My attempt at spreading motivation, passion and fun. I imagine other instructors may find these videos, please feel free to use the choreography in your class.
