**Meraki**:  This is a modern Greek word often used to describe what happens when you leave a piece of yourself (your soul, creativity, or love) in your work. When you love doing something, anything, so much that you put something of yourself into it.

The way I live my life was forever changed when my little brother was diagnosed with lupus, an incurable autoimmune disease. He was healthy his entire life, with no known family history, no warning and no explanation. His struggle with this chronic inflammatory disease is undoubtedly the hardest daily obstacle my family is faced with. 

There is so much unknown about lupus. It affects every body differently. After his diagnosis, I went on emotional roller coaster; feeling anger, sadness, guilt (wishing it had been me instead of him) and then anger all over again. Eventually I felt a change. I lost all tolerance for bullshit, for negativity, for certain arbitrary complaints that people have (ie- traffic, boyfriend problems, makeup, clothes, etc). I began to look at the world differently and started evaluating my own life and lifestyle. I started to ask myself questions. Why am I tolerating this unhealthy relationship? Why do I keep friends who don’t care about me? Why stay at a job I don’t like?  Why is so much value placed on fashion and the way we are perceived by others? 

Most importantly, I felt extreme value placed on the things that money can’t buy. I asked myself, what do I want to spend my life doing? How can I help my brother? What makes people laugh and smile? How can I inspire others and help bring them together? 

The devastation I felt when my brother was diagnosed forced me to evaluate the choices I had been making in my life. Certain things became very clear; unanswered questions found resolution. I needed to change the course of my life and do something that inspires. Something that matters more than just a paycheck. For me, that is music. I put everything I have into my music, a piece of me remains in my music. This is why I am calling my first project the Meraki mission.
